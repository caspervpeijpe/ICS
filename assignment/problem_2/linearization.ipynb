This way, when we run our checks, the system will check the existence of the cell ids and verify the number of points and which checks must be run. While there are ways that you can edit the metadata and work around the restrictions to delete or modify these special cells, you should not do that since then our nbgrader backend will not be able to parse your notebook and give you points for the assignment.
