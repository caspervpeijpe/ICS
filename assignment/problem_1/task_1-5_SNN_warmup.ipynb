    "The training process is similar to traditional neural networks. snnTorch also supports the PyTorch optimizer. We can see that the loss is reduced during training. Since we only have one training data, the results don't have any real meaning. This is just a small demo based on the fully connected network structure. You will complete an SNN based on the CNN network structure in the practical assignment problem1 and use it to predict the angle variation of the double pendulum. Good luck with the following work!\n",
